        <p className="text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 mt-2">
          The Goobs have sent an elite space force to occupy Aegis, the galaxy's
          central hub dedicated to saving lives across the galaxy. This
          futuristic space station floats in a serene nebula, and it's the last
          beacon of hope in the vast and dangerous expanse of space. Equipped
          with powerful scanners and teleportation gates, Aegis connects distant
          worlds and provides a lifeline in the galaxy's most perilous regions.
          From here, they embark on their journeys, navigating the galaxy's
          dangers to rescue those in distress and tackle the most formidable
          dangers.

          Aegis handles changing the simulated world over time and executing
          commands from agents, then sending the results back to the agents.
          Aegis runs as an independent process on the user's machine. Before the
          simulation begins, agents connect to Aegis from their own processes.
          Communication between Aegis and the agents is handled via sockets.
