## What is Aegis?

The Goobs have sent an elite space force to occupy Aegis, the galaxy's central hub dedicated to saving lives across the galaxy.
This futuristic space station floats in a serene nebula, and it's the last beacon of hope in the vast and dangerous expanse of space.
Equipped with powerful scanners and teleportation gates, Aegis connects distant worlds and provides
a lifeline in the galaxy's most perilous regions. From here, they embark on their journeys, navigating
the galaxy's dangers to rescue those in distress and tackle the most formidable dangers.
