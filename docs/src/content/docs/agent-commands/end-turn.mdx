## Overview

The `END_TURN` command signifies that an agent has finished its actions for the current
round. By sending this command, the agent informs the server that it is no longer active
in the current round, allowing simulation to progress to the next turn.

#### Example

```py
self._agent.send(END_TURN())
```
