## Client Tabs Overview

The Aegis client has several tabs, each serving a specific purpose. Here's a breakdown:

### Aegis Tab

Once you select a world and specify the rounds, use this tab to launch Aegis.

### Agents Tab

In this tab, you’ll manage your agents. For Assignment 1, you’ll connect a single agent. This is where you specify which agent you want to run. 

### Game Tab

This tab provides a real-time view of your simulation statistics.

### Editor Tab

Here, you can create and customize world maps. Think of this tab as your creative space, where you design the worlds your agents will explore.

### Settings Tab

If you ever need to reconfigure the Aegis code path or toggle move cost, this is the tab to visit.

## World Editor Brushes

When editing the world map, you'll use various brushes to place objects and configure cell types. Each brush has its own purpose:

### Special Cells Brush

This brush adds special map elements like spawns, fire, killer, and charging cells.

### Move Cost Brush

This brush adjusts the move cost for each cell, with values from 2-5 or custom options, and color visualization for easier editing.

### Stack Content Brush

The Stack Content Brush lets you add objects to the cell stacks. For assignment 1, you’ll only need to place one survivor on the world map.

### View Brush

With the View Brush, you can inspect cell details and properties in a read-only mode. It’s perfect for analyzing the world without making any modifications.

## Editing Tips

Editing maps can be tricky, but these tips will help streamline the process:

- **Left-click** to place objects.
- **Right-click** to delete them.
- Make sure to select the correct brush type before placing or deleting specific objects.

## Client UI Components

The client’s UI is designed for clarity and ease of use. Below is a breakdown of the essential components:

### World Objects

In the world view, you’ll see survivors, groups, rubble*, and special cells. These elements are represented visually to help you identify key features in the world.

1. **Survivor** (light blue)
2. **Survivor Group** (dark blue)
3. **Rubble**
4. **Charging Cell**
5. **Killer Cell**

- **Previous/Next Buttons**: Move backward or forward by one round at a time.
- **Play/Pause**: Control simulation playback to pause or resume the action.
- **Minimize Button**: Hide the timeline to give more space to the world view.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - **J**/**L** or **left**/**right** arrow to move between rounds.
  - Press **Space**/**K** to play/pause.
  - Press **M** to minimize/maximize the timeline.

### Info Panels

The client has several Info Panels that provide detailed data on specific components:

- **Cell Panel**: Displays the cell type, move cost, agents present, and other relevant information for each cell.
- **Agent Panel**: Shows detailed agent information, including location, energy, latest command, and current layer details.
