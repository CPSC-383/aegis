There are two ways to run Aegis: using the provided script or via the client.

## Using the provided script

To run Aegis in the command line, use the `run_headless_aegis_with_agents.py` script. 
The usage of the python script is shown below:

```bash
python run_headless_aegis_with_agents.py \
  --agent-amount <agent amount> \
  --rounds <num of rounds> \
  --agent <agent directory> \
  --world <world file>
```

For Assignment 1, the `--agent-amount` argument is optional as it defaults to 1. You can omit
this argument when running the command. Below is an example of how to execute the simulation using
the `example_agent` and `ExampleWorld`, configured to run for 50 rounds:

```bash
python run_headless_aegis_with_agents.py \
  --rounds 50 \
  --agent example_agent \
  --world ExampleWorld
```

If you need a quick reminder on how to use the script, simply include the `-h` flag to display the help menu.

```bash
python run_headless_aegis_with_agents.py -h
```

## Using the client

You can either open the client from the command line or a file
explorer. Run the following in the `aegis` folder if you
use the command line:

<Tabs defaultValue="mac">

<TabsList>

<TabsTrigger value="mac">Mac</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="windows">Windows</TabsTrigger>
<TabsTrigger value="linux">Linux</TabsTrigger>

</TabsList>

<TabsContent value="mac">

```bash
cd client
open Aegis.app
```

If you get the following error, click [here](/common-errors/mac-errors) for a step-by-step solution.

</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="windows">

```bash
cd client
.\aegis-client.exe
```

</TabsContent>

<TabsContent value="linux">

```bash
cd client
./aegis-client.AppImage
```

</TabsContent>

</Tabs>

Once the client opens, follow the steps below to run a game.

<Steps>

### Setting Up Aegis

Since the client can't automatically find the Aegis code, you'll need to set it up manually. Click on the _Setup Aegis Path_ button,
and select the aegis root directory. If set up properly, the sidebar tabs will appear and the client should display a list of available
worlds when you attempt to select one.

### Starting Up Aegis

In the Aegis tab, select a world, and configure the number of rounds. Once the _Start Up Game_ button becomes active, click it. Youâ€™ll
know Aegis has started successfully when either the console confirms it or the button changes to _Kill Game_. At this point, you can proceed
to connect your agents.

### Connecting Agents

Go to the Agents tab, choose the agent you wish to use, and assign it a group name. When the _Connect Agent_ button becomes active, click
it to connect your agents.

### Simulation

If everything has been set up correctly, you should see the simulation appear.
