## What is Aegis?

The Goobs have sent an elite space force to occupy Aegis, the galaxy's central hub dedicated to saving lives across the galaxy.
This futuristic space station floats in a serene nebula, and it's the last beacon of hope in the vast and dangerous expanse of space.
Equipped with powerful scanners and teleportation gates, Aegis connects distant worlds and provides
a lifeline in the galaxy's most perilous regions. From here, they embark on their journeys, navigating
the galaxy's dangers to rescue those in distress and tackle the most formidable dangers.

## Aegis Server

Aegis handles changing the simulated world over time and executing commands from agents, then sending the results back to the agents.
Aegis runs as an independent process on the user's machine. Before the simulation begins, agents connect to Aegis from their own processes.
Communication between Aegis and the agents is handled via sockets.

Aegis operates in four main phases:

<Steps>

### Start up

The simulated world is set up, and the protocol files for the simulation are created.

### Waiting for Connections

Aegis waits for incoming connections from the agents.

### Running the Simulation

No new connections are accepted. The simulation progresses step-by-step.

### Shutdown

Aegis notifies all connected agents that the system is shutting down and closes all protocol files.

</Steps>

## Basic Parts of Aegis

Aegis consists of two separate processes, each handling different aspects of the simulation:

<Steps>

### The Controller

This is the main process of the simulator. It manages all communication with agents, executes the simulation,
and maintains the current state of the world. It updates the world as events happen.

### The Client

When used, the Client provides a graphical interface via an Electron-based GUI. It communicates with the Controller
through a WebSocket connection, allowing it to display real-time updates of the worldâ€™s state during the simulation.
Additionally, it allows users to create their own worlds.

</Steps>

## Simulation

A simulation consists of multiple rounds, with each round being a single time step in the simulated world.
During each round, each agent is given one second to decide what action to take. Aegis processes each agent
one by one and waits for their command.

The last command received at the end of the turn is the one that will be executed for that round.
