## Agents and the Simulated World in Aegis

In the Aegis simulation, agents are members of the elite space force, tasked with navigating a hazardous environment and rescuing survivors.
Here's what you need to know to design an agent that can survive — and thrive — in this environment:

  Agents can't talk to each other directly. All communication and actions must go through Aegis.

### World Knowledge

Agents must build their own understanding of the world as they explore it. At the beginning of the simulation, an agent only has partial
knowledge of the environment. They will gradually uncover more as they interact with the world.

Initial information includes:

- **Fire Cells**: Dangerous zones where agents may take damage.
- **Killer Cells**: Lethal areas that can instantly endanger an agent’s life.
- **Charging Cells**: Safe zones where agents can restore energy.
- **Presence of Survivors**: Signals indicating potential survivors in the current cell.
- **Move Cost**: The energy required to enter a cell (if this setting is enabled). 

### World Layout

The world is structured as a grid of square cells. Each cell includes the following attributes:

#### Stack of Objects

A stack may contain:

- **Survivors**: People that agents must rescue.
- **Rubble**: Debris that must be cleared before reaching survivors.

#### Move Cost

Each cell has an energy cost for entry. Some paths may be more expensive to traverse, requiring agents to plan their movement efficiently.

#### Cell Type

Each cell is one of the following:

- **CHARGING_CELL** — recharge energy here
- **FIRE_CELL** — hazard: may cause damage
- **KILLER_CELL** — high-risk hazard
- **NORMAL_CELL** — safe and walkable

#### Field of View

An agent's vision is limited and includes:

- **Current Cell (Life Signals)**: The agent can detect life signals of stacked objects in its current cell. However, objects deeper in the
stack may appear distorted or harder to detect.
- **Surrounding Cells (1-Cell Radius)**: The agent sees the top object of each nearby cell (e.g., north, northwest, east, etc.) within
a 1-cell radius.

## Agent Commands

Agents use a predefined set of commands to interact with Aegis. Each command is sent during the agent's `THINK` state.

## Agent States

Agents go through a fixed cycle of states each round. These states determine what the agent is allowed to do and when it can process or send information.

<Steps>

### IDLE

The agent is waiting for a signal from Aegis. It should not attempt to send commands during this state.

### READ_MAIL

The agent receives the `MESSAGES_START` command and begins reading incoming messages.  
It will return to `IDLE` upon receiving the `MESSAGES_END` command.

### GET_CMD_RESULT

The agent receives the `CMD_RESULT_START` command, indicating that the result of the previous command is being delivered.  
It returns to `IDLE` after the `CMD_RESULT_END` command is received.

### THINK

The agent receives the `ROUND_START` command, indicating it can now compute and send its next action.  
It should finish thinking and issuing its command before receiving the `ROUND_END` command, which signals a return to `IDLE`.
