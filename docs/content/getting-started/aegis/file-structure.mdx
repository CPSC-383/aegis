The Aegis client uses a specific structure for agents and worlds. Be sure to follow these guidelines so the client can find and run the necessary files correctly.

All of the following files and folders should already be included in your assignment.

### Agent Structure

The agent files are organized under the `src/agents` directory. Follow the structure outlined below to ensure the client can locate and
execute your agents properly.

<Tree>
  <TreeItem name="aegis" type="folder">
    <TreeItem name="src" type="folder">
      <TreeItem name="agents" type="folder">
        <TreeItem name="example_agent" type="folder">
          <TreeItem name="example_agent.py" />
          <TreeItem name="main.py" />
        </TreeItem>
      </TreeItem>
    </TreeItem>
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>

- `aegis/src/agents/`: This is the main folder where all agents should reside.
- `example_agent/`: Each agent should have its own directory (e.g., example_agent), named appropriately.
- `example_agent.py`: This file contains the agent's logic.

#### Main.py

<Admonition variant="danger" title="Don't Edit">

Don't edit the `main.py` file in the `example_agent` directory. 

All of your custom agent logic should be placed in a separate file (e.g., `example_agent.py`). 
The `main.py` file is already set up to serve as the entry point for the agent, and changing it may cause
the client to fail to recognize or run your agent.

</Admonition>

The `main.py` file is the entry point for your agent. It is required for every agent and should be placed inside the agent's directory.
Without a `main.py` file, your agent won't run and the client won't be able to find it.

Here's an example of what a `main.py` file looks like:

```py
import sys

from a1.agent import BaseAgent
from agents.example_agent.example_agent import ExampleAgent


def main() -> None:
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        BaseAgent.get_agent().start_test(ExampleAgent())
    elif len(sys.argv) == 2:
        BaseAgent.get_agent().start_with_group_name(sys.argv[1], ExampleAgent())
    else:
        print("Agent: Usage: python3 agents/example_agent/main.py <groupname>")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Recommended Agent Logic File

While the `main.py` file is the entry point for your agent, itâ€™s a good idea to separate the agent's logic into a different file. 
In the example above, the agent's logic is defined in `example_agent.py`. This separation helps maintain a clean structure and keeps
the logic modular and easier to manage.

Feel free to make as many files as you want.

### World Structure

World files are stored in the `worlds` directory.

<Tree>
  <TreeItem name="aegis" type="folder">
      <TreeItem name="worlds" type="folder">
      <TreeItem name="ExampleWorld.world" />
    </TreeItem>
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>

- **File Extension**: All world files must have the `.world` extension.
- **File Placement**: Place new world files in the `worlds` directory to ensure they can be accessed by the client.
