## Agents and the Simulated world in Aegis

In the Aegis simulation, agents are members of the elite space force. Here’s what you need to know:

  Agents can't talk to each other directly. All communication and actions must go through Aegis.
</Admonition>

### World

Each agent has to build their own world as they move around. At the start, they only know basic information of the world.
The information includes:

- **Fire Cells**: Dangerous areas where agents may incur damage.
- **Killing Cells**: Cells that can immediately endanger the agent’s life.
- **Charging Cells**: Cells where agents can recharge their energy.
- **Presence of Survivors**: Whether or not a cell contains survivors in need of rescue.

### World Layout

Each square in the world grid has the following attributes:

#### Stack of Objects

This can include:

- **Survivors**: People awaiting rescue.
- **Rubble**: Debris that needs to be cleared.

#### Move Cost

The energy lost when moving onto a square. Some squares may have higher move costs than others, requiring agents to strategize their path.

#### Cell Type

Each cell can have one of the following types:

- **CHARGING_CELL**: For recharging energy.
- **FIRE_CELL**: A hazard where agents may take damage.
- **KILLER_CELL**: A lethal hazard that can immediately endanger agents.
- **NORMAL_CELL**: A walkable space with no hazards.

#### Field of View

Agents have a limited view of the world. Their field of view includes:
- **Current Square with Life Signals**: The square the agent is currently on, displaying life signals for objects in that square. 
Note that deeper layers may distort these signals, making it harder to detect objects or survivors deeper within the stack.
- **Surrounding Squares within 1-Square Radius**: The immediate surroundings of the agent (e.g., north, northwest, etc.), allowing
the agent to see basic details, including the top object in each square.

## Agent Commands

Agents can use the following commands to interact with Aegis. Click on each command for more information.

## Agent States

Each round involves four main states for an agent:

<Steps>

### IDLE

The agent is waiting for instructions from Aegis.

### READ_MAIL

The agent has received the `MESSAGES_START` command and will start processing messages from the other agents.
The agent returns to the `IDLE` state when it receives the `MESSAGES_END` command.

### GET_CMD_RESULT

The agent has received the `CMD_RESULT_START` command, indicating that Aegis is sending the results for the last command.
The agent returns to the `IDLE` state when it receives the `CMD_RESULT_END` command.

### THINK

The agent has received the `ROUND_START` command, allowing it to begin computing its actions for the current round.
The agent returns to the `IDLE` state when it receives the `ROUND_END` command.

</Steps>
