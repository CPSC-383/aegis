## Overview

The `World` class represents a two-dimensional grid system designed for
cell-based navigation. It serves as the core data structure that your
agents will interact with, supporting key functionalities such as
movement, pathfinding, and cell manipulation.

## Attributes

<Attribute
  name="width"
  type="int"
  description="The width of the world. Ranging from 0 (inclusive) to the width (exclusive). "
/>
<Attribute
  name="height"
  type="int"
  description="The height of the world. Ranging from 0 (inclusive) to the height (exclusive). "
/>

## Methods

### get_world_grid()

<Method
  name="get_world_grid"
  description="Returns the 2D grid representing the world."
  returns={{
    type: "list[list[Cell]]",
    description:
      "A two-dimensional list of Cell objects representing the world's grid structure.",
  }}
/>

**Example:**

```py
# world has height and width set to 3 for this example.

for row in world.get_world_grid():
  for cell in row:
    print(cell)

# Output: 
Cell ( (0,0), Move_Cost 1)
        {
        }
Cell ( (0,1), Move_Cost 1)
        {
        }
.
.
.

Cell ( (2,2), Move_Cost 1)
        {
        }
```

### get_cell_at(location: Location)

<Method
  name="get_cell_at"
  description="Returns the cell at the given location if it exists."
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "location",
      type: "Location",
      description: "The location of the cell.",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  returns={{
    type: "Cell | None",
    description:
      "The Cell object at the given location, or None if the location is invalid or out of bounds.",
  }}
/>

**Example:**

```py
# world has height and width set to 3 for this example.

# Valid location
loc = create_location(1, 1)
print(world.get_cell_at(loc))

# Outputs:
Cell ( (1,1), Move_Cost 1)
      {
        # Stack Content here, if there are any layers.       
      }

# Invalid location
loc = create_location(4, 1)
print(world.get_cell_at(loc))

# Outputs:
None
```

### on_map(location: Location)

<Method
  name="on_map"
  description="Checks if a given location is on the map."
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "location",
      type: "Location",
      description: "The location to check.",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  returns={{
    type: "bool",
    description: "True if the location is on the map, False otherwise.",
  }}
/>

**Example:**

```py
# world has height and width set to 3 for this example.

# Invalid Location
is_on_map = world.on_map(create_location(3,3))
print(is_on_map)
# Output: False

# Valid Location
is_on_map = world.on_map(create_location(1, 2))
print(is_on_map)
# Output: True
```
