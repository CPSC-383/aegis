## Cannot Run Aegis Due to Security Warning

**Problem**: MacOS blocks Aegis from running with a message stating "Cannot verify developer" or similar security warnings.

**Solution**:

<Steps>

### Open System Settings
Navigate to the Apple menu and click on "System Settings" (or "System Preferences" on older MacOS versions).

### Locate Security Settings
Select "Privacy & Security" from the sidebar. Scroll down to the "Security" section.

### Allow Aegis to Run
Look for the message "Aegis was blocked from use because it is not from an identified developer" (or something similar) and click "Open Anyway" next to it.

### Confirm Your Choice
In the popup that appears, click "Open" to confirm you want to run Aegis.

</Steps>
