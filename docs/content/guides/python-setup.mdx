Homebrew is the best way to install Python on macOS.

<Steps>

### Check for Homebrew

Run the following command to check if Homebrew is already installed:

```bash
brew --version
```

If you see a version number, you can skip to **Step 5**.  
If you see `command not found: brew`, proceed to the next step.

### Install Homebrew

Run the following installation script from [brew.sh](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```

You may be prompted for your macOS password.

### Add Homebrew to Your PATH

After installation, watch for this warning:

```txt
Warning: /opt/homebrew/bin is not in your PATH.
Instructions on how to configure your shell for Homebrew
can be found in the 'Next steps' section below.
```

If you see that message, run the following to configure your shell:

```bash
echo 'eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)' >> ~/.zprofile
eval $(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)
```

This ensures the `brew` command will work the next time you open your terminal.

### Confirm Homebrew Installation

Restart your terminal and run:

```bash
brew --version
```

You should see a version number confirming it's correctly installed.

### Install Python 3.12.10

Now install Python with:

```bash
brew install python@3.12
```

If the output mentions conflicting files or says it can't link `python@3.12`, run:

```bash
brew link --overwrite python@3.12
```

### Confirm Python Version

Verify the installation with:

```bash
python3.12 --version
```

You should see:

```txt
Python 3.12.10
```

<Admonition variant="caution" title="Python Path">

If you forget to check the PATH box, Python won't work in the terminal until you fix your environment variables.

</Admonition>

### Confirm the Installation

Open **Command Prompt** and run:

```bash
python --version
```

You should see:

```txt
Python 3.12.10
```

If not, try:
