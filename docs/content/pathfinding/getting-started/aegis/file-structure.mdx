The Aegis client expects a specific structure for both agents and world files. Be sure to follow this structure so that the client can locate and run everything correctly.

All required folders and files are included in your assignment starter code.

## Agent Structure

Agent code lives in the `src/agents` directory. Here's what the expected layout looks like:

<Tree>
  <TreeItem name="aegis" type="folder">
    <TreeItem name="src" type="folder">
      <TreeItem name="agents" type="folder">
        <TreeItem name="example_agent" type="folder">
          <TreeItem name="example_agent.py" />
          <TreeItem name="main.py" />
        </TreeItem>
      </TreeItem>
    </TreeItem>
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>

- `aegis/src/agents/`: The base folder for all agents.
- `example_agent/`: Each agent lives in its own directory, named appropriately.
- `example_agent.py`: This is where your custom agent logic goes.

### main.py

<Admonition variant="danger" title="Don't Edit">

Do not modify the `main.py` file in the `example_agent/` directory.

This file is the predefined entry point used by the Aegis client. Editing it may prevent your agent from being recognized or executed properly.

</Admonition>

Each agent directory must include a `main.py` file. This file handles launching the agent and connecting it to the Aegis server. Here's what a typical `main.py` looks like:

```py
import sys

from a1.agent import BaseAgent
from agents.example_agent.example_agent import ExampleAgent


def main() -> None:
    if len(sys.argv) == 1:
        BaseAgent.get_agent().start_test(ExampleAgent())
    elif len(sys.argv) == 2:
        BaseAgent.get_agent().start_with_group_name(sys.argv[1], ExampleAgent())
    else:
        print("Agent: Usage: python3 agents/example_agent/main.py <groupname>")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

### Organizing Agent Logic

Although `main.py` is the required entry point, it's strongly recommended to place your actual agent logic in a separate file like `example_agent.py`.

This keeps your code modular and clean, especially as agents become more complex. Youâ€™re also free to break your agent logic into multiple files if it helps with organization.

## World Structure

World files live in the `worlds` directory.

<Tree>
  <TreeItem name="aegis" type="folder">
    <TreeItem name="worlds" type="folder">
      <TreeItem name="ExampleWorld.world" />
    </TreeItem>
  </TreeItem>
</Tree>

- **File Extension**: All world files must use the `.world` extension.
- **File Placement**: All `.world` files must go in the `worlds/` directory for the client to detect them.
