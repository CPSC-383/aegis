## What is Aegis?

The Goobs have dispatched an elite space force to take control of Aegis — the galaxy’s central hub for lifesaving operations.  
Floating in a serene nebula, this futuristic space station serves as the last beacon of hope in a vast and dangerous universe.

Equipped with powerful scanners and teleportation gates, Aegis bridges distant worlds and provides a lifeline to the galaxy’s most perilous regions. From here, agents launch their missions, facing galactic threats to rescue those in need.

## Aegis Server

The Aegis server manages the simulation lifecycle: it evolves the world over time, processes commands from agents, and returns results. It runs as an independent process on your machine.

Before a simulation starts, agents must connect to Aegis from their own processes. Communication is handled over sockets.

Aegis operates in four main phases:

<Steps>

### Startup

The simulated world is initialized, and protocol files for the simulation are created.

### Waiting for Connections

Aegis waits for all agents to connect.

### Running the Simulation

No new connections are accepted. The simulation progresses round by round.

### Shutdown

All connected agents are notified of shutdown, and protocol files are closed.

</Steps>

## Basic Parts of Aegis

Aegis is made up of two key components, each with its own responsibilities:

<Steps>

### The Controller

The Controller is the core of the simulator. It manages agent communication, executes the simulation, and maintains the current world state, updating it as events occur.

### The Client

The Client is an optional graphical interface built with Electron. It connects to the Controller via WebSocket to display real-time simulation updates.  
In addition to visualization, it also lets users build and edit custom worlds.

</Steps>

## Simulation

Each simulation consists of multiple rounds. A single round represents one time step in the world.

During each round:

- Agents are given **one second** to compute and send their action.
- Aegis processes agents one at a time.

The final command received before the turn ends is the one that will be used for that round.
