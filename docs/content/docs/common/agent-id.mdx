## Overview

The AgentID data structure is designed to uniquely identify an agent within a specific group. It consists of two key attributes:
an ID, which uniquely identifies the agent, and a Group ID (GID), which represents the group to which the agent belongs.
This ensures that each agent can be distinctly recognized both within their own group and across potentially multiple groups.
