## Overview

The `Location` class provides a robust interface for managing two-dimensional coordinates.

## Attributes

<Attribute
  name="x"
  type="int"
  description="Horizontal coordinate representing the x-axis position."
/>
<Attribute
  name="y"
  type="int"
  description="Vertical coordinate representing the y-axis position."
/>

## Methods

### add(direction: Direction)

<Method
  description="Adds the given direction to the current location."
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "direction",
      type: "Direction",
      description: "The direction to add to the current location.",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  returns={{
    type: "Location",
    description:
      "A new Location object one unit away in the given direction.",
  }}
/>

**Example:**

```py
loc = create_location(3, 2)
north_location = loc.add(Direction.NORTH)
# Returns location at (3, 3)
```

### direction_to(location: Location)

<Method
  description="Calculate the direction between the current location and a target location."
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "location",
      type: "Location",
      description: "The target location.",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  returns={{
    type: "Direction",
    description:
      "A Direction enum value representing the direction between locations.",
  }}
/>

**Example:**

```py
start = create_location(0, 0)
goal = create_location(0, 5)
dir = start.direction_to(goal) 
# Returns Direction.NORTH
```

### distance_to(location: Location)

<Admonition variant="danger" title="Warning: Incorrect Heuristic">

This should **not** be used in your A* heuristic! Using an improper heuristic can lead
to suboptimal or incorrect pathfinding results.

</Admonition>

<Method
  description="Calculates the squared distance between the current location and the given location."
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "location",
      type: "Location",
      description: "The location to which the distance is calculated.",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  returns={{
    type: "Direction",
    description:
      "The squared distance to the given location.",
  }}
/>

**Example:**

```py
start = create_location(1, 2)
goal = create_location(3, 5)
dist = start.distance_to(goal) 
# Returns 13 
```

## Factory Functions

### create_location(x: int, y: int)

<Method
  description="Create a new Location object at the specified coordinates."
  parameters={[
    {
      name: "x",
      type: "int",
      description: "The x-coordinate of the location.",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "y",
      type: "int",
      description: "The y-coordinate of the location.",
      required: true,
    },
  ]}
  returns={{
    type: "Location",
    description: "A new Location object at the specified coordinates.",
  }}
/>

**Example:**

```py
loc = create_location(5, 4)
# Returns a Location object with the coordinates (5, 4)
```

## Additional Notes

The `Location` class is designed to support comparison operations. Locations can be
compared using standard operators such as `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, and `>=`.
This allows for easy sorting and comparison of locations. For example, locations can
be stored in sorted containers like lists, sets, and heaps.
