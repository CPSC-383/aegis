title: AgentID 
description: A data structure for uniquely identifying an agent.
---

## Overview

The `AgentID` data structure is designed to uniquely identify an agent within a specific group. 
It consists of two key attributes: an ID, which uniquely identifies the agent, and a Group ID (GID),
which represents the group to which the agent belongs. This ensures that each agent can be distinctly
recognized both within their own group and across potentially multiple groups.

## Signature

```py
AgentID(id: int, gid: int)
```

| Param | Type | Description | 
|------|------|-------------|
| `id` | `int` | An integer that uniquely identifies the agent within a group. |
| `gid` | `int` | An integer that represents the group identifier for the agent. |

## Example

```py
agent_id = AgentID(3, 1)
print(agent_id.id)   # Output: 3
print(agent_id.gid)  # Output: 1
```
