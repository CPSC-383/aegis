## Overview

The `PREDICT` command is used to make a preidiction on previously saved survivors.
The `surv_id` parameter can be accessed after a survivor has been saved (`SAVE_SURV_RESULT`),
allowing predictions to be associated with specific survivors.

## Params

<Attribute
  name="surv_id"
  type="int"
  description="The id of the survivor (predictions are based on saved survivors, so this is the id of the survivor associated with the prediction)."
  required
/>

<Attribute
  name="label"
  type="np.int64"
  description="The label of the prediction."
  required
/>

**Example:**

```py
self._agent.send(PREDICT(2, 5))
```
