## Overview

The `SAVE_SURV` command allows an agent to rescue a survivor from a cell.
By issuing this command, the agent helps a survivor escape harm or be
brought to safety. Some survivors may require the assistance of multiple agents
to be successfully saved.

**Example:**

```py
self._agent.send(SAVE_SURV())
```
