prob1-1: fine: isolated agents but no surv in isolated area, kinda weird
prob1-2: fine: some pathfinding required (have to walk around walls, fuzzy nav should work)
prob1-3: fixed: changed spawn zones from all "any" to 6 "group" and 1 "any"
prob1-4: fine: some pathfinding required (have to walk around walls, fuzzy nav should work)
prob1-5: fixed: again many islolated agents but no penalty if they just kill themselves
                changed spawn zones from all "any" to 6 "group" and 1 "any"
                also pathfinding required (have to walk around long wall, fuzzy nav with no backtracking should work)
prob1-6: fixed: changed spawn zones from all "any" to 6 "group" and 1 "any"
prob1-7: fixed: changed spawn zones from all "any" to 6 "group" and 1 "any"
prob1-8: good
prob1-9: good
prob1-10: good


prob2-1: bad: no rubble on top of survivors
prob2-2: good
prob2-3: ...good
prob2-4: good
prob2-5: bad: no rubble on top of survivors (and some pathfinding required, fuzzy nav following wall should work)
prob2-6: good
prob2-7: bad: rubble *around* surv, but not on top of them!
prob2-8: good
prob2-9: good
prob2-10: bad: rubble *around* surv, but not on top of them!
               made with old aegis, converted (hopefully) to new map format
prob2-11: bad: no rubble on top of survivors, only in front of them!
               some pathfinding required (prob harder than fuzzy nav (have to move backwards))


prob3-1: fixed: added 1 extra energy to reach charging grid AND send sleep to recharge
prob3-2: fixed: made with old aegis, converted (hopefully) to new map format
prob3-3: fixed: added 2 extra energy to reach charging grid AND send sleep to recharge
prob3-4: fixed: added 1 extra energy to reach charging grid AND send sleep to recharge
prob3-5: bad: lots of pathfinding required (harder than fuzzy nav), sleeping on same spot
prob3-6: fixed but bad: added 1 extra energy to reach charging grid AND send sleep to recharge
                               tons of pathfinding required + tons of sleeping on same spot
prob3-7: fixed: took away some intial energy, and moved charging grid one closer (so not same distance as surv, or else no point having it)
prob3-8: probably bad: some pathfinding required (long walk around walls)


prob4-1: fixed and probably fine: made with old aegis, converted (hopefully) to new map format
                                  some pathfinding required (fuzzy nav around walls should work)
prob4-2: good
prob4-3: good: 7 agents -> 4 survs to save, some survs have 2 agents required rubble above them too.
prob4-4: bad: lots of pathfinding required
prob4-5: fixed: changed spawn zones from all "any" to most "group" and 1 "any"
prob4-6: good


prob5-1: fixed: changed spawn zones from all "any" to 5 "group" and 1 "any"
prob5-2: good
prob5-3: probably bad: requires pathfinding around tiles with insane move costs
prob5-4: fixed: reset back to 500 energy, since agents ran out, and this challenge isnt testing energy management
prob5-5: bad: requires decent pathfinding
prob5-6: good
